MTN has settled the dispute between the CBN and its operations in Nigeria.  The CBN Governor,  mr Godwin Emefiele has on Tuesday revealed that MTN has paid $53 million to settle a money transfer dispute with Nigeria’s central bank and the management since the matter has been withdrawn from court.  Amehnews recall that the central bank had ordered MTN and its lenders to bring back a total of $8.1 billion it alleged the company had illegally repatriated using improperly issued paperwork between 2007 and 2008.  Emefiele said the money paid by MTN was a notional sum and that the company has been absolved from any wrongdoing.  He stated this during the Tuesday monetary policy meeting at Abuja which the bank left interest rates on hold at 14 percent.
