The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc has said it will partner the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria on human capacity development. The Group Managing Director of NAHCO, Mrs Olatokunbo Fagbemi, disclosed this while receiving a delegation of the Ikeja District of ICAN, who paid her a courtesy visit. Fagbemi said the group would partner with ICAN in organising in-house training for staff who were accountants and others who were non – accounting staff of the company for capacity development and financial literacy. While she also commended the role NAHCO’s chartered accountants played in the development of the company, Fagbemi said the firm had a sizeable number of chartered accountants and that it had always supported their participation in ICAN programmes. “At NAHCO, we believe in training and retraining of staff. That is why we have a semi-autonomous unit called learning and development enabled with global affiliations which handles aviation related training for the company. Our staff are some of the best trained in the industry,” he said. She pointed out that the company would not relent in giving the best training to its staff. Fagbemi explained that the company had to run a harmonised group structure, adding that since NAHCO was a group with a number of subsidiary companies, it had to be properly run as a group in a way that would bring value to shareholders. The Chairman, Ikeja District of ICAN, Mr Oni Olalere, who commended the management of the NAHCO, stated that the institute was happy with the level of support the company had been giving to its members working  there as well as the Ikeja District of the Institute. “We are happy with the support NAHCO gives to the members working in the organisation,” he said.
