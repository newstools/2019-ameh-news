The Comptroller- General, Nigeria Customs Service, Col Hameed Ali(retd.), has ordered the seizure of cargoes with improper documentation. Our correspondent learnt that the order came on the heels of an increase in the level of discrepancies observed in importers’ names and other information provided on clearance documents. The order was contained in a recent circular directing all area controllers to profile all Single Goods Declaration  forms,  Forms ‘M’, the Bill of lading and manifest ,that the  names and details of the importers on them were different from the names and details on the  importers’ Pre Arrival Assessment Report. Ali, therefore, directed Area Commands to suspend the release of such cargoes till further notice. The Customs CG lamented that there had been an increase in the level of discrepancies in information provided by importers on the three clearing documents. He directed all the consignees of cargoes to henceforth make sure that there were no discrepancies on consignee’s name on the PAAR, SGD form and Bill of lading. The circular signed by Deputy Comptroller- General of Customs in charge of Tariff and Trade, Isa Talatu,  stated in part, “The CGC has observed with dismay and great concern,  increasing cases of discrepancies on consignee’s name on the PAAR, SGD and Bill of lading,  despite three previous circulars to that effect. “Consequently, the CGC has directed once more that: the consignee’s name, quantity and description of goods on the PAAR must tally with the one on the SGD and Bill of lading or Airway bills. Manifest amendment must strictly be done in accordance with the extant guidelines. “Any observed discrepancy must be referred to the CAC, who will direct 100 per cent inspection on the consignment  and seek  further directives from the deputy comptroller -general in charge of Trade and Tariff.”
