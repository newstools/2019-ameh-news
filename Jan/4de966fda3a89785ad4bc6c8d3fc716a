The Nigeria Customs Service has raised an alarm that there are over 1,000 illegal routes around land borders in Nigeria and that this has been a major challenge in its war against smugglers.  Customs Area Controller in charge of Seme border command, Compt Uba Muhammed while briefing journalists last week disclosed that given the number of illegal routes, a combination of all security operatives at the port cannot effectively cover all the routes, both legal and illegal.  At the Same area alone, Uba said there are about 87 unapproved routes which smugglers are accessing to perpetuate crime.  The Controller however assured that the Seme customs command under his watch is leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that all the unidentified or identified routes are combed by trained Customs personnel.  He said “When we are talking about border we are talking of entry and exit and it is not limited to the land borders, the seaport and airport is also a border”  “We have approved routes and unapproved routes, for instance, if you are an international passenger or even local, if you are entering an airport, you cannot just enter through anywhere you see, these are what we call the government approved routes”  “These are the places where security agencies are stationed there to continue to carry out their constitutional duties, however, there are patrol bases because somebody who intends to commit an offence will hardly pass through the approved route, they will continue to look for the illegal routes so that they will continue with their illegality”  “Such routes are being covered by our various officers by patrol bases, who continue to patrol along the roads. The porosity of the border is so much that even if all the security agencies; Police, Customs and Army, we hold our hands, we would not be able to cover the land borders anywhere in Nigeria  I don’t want to guess, but we have over 1,000 unapproved routes in Nigeria”  “In the Seme area here I think they have 87 unapproved routes”  “These are the routes that smugglers and other people who continue to commit illegality, so it is for this reason that I call on the public to give us any information on such illegal activities” he said  Comptr Uba also noted that smuggling has continued to thrive at the Seme border because the communities across the border have failed to ensure adherence to the policies of the government.  “These smugglers as well as the border communities have been trading for ages; hence they see the government policing/ restrictions as a threat to their business. However, Policing and restrictions are usually in the best interest of the nation either to grow local capacity or for the safety and security of the nation” he said  The Caption Photo: Customs Area Controller in charge of Seme Border Command, Compt Uba Muhammed
