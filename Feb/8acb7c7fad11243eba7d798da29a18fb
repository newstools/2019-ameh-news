The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has said it impounded a total of 5,377.125 kilograms of drugs at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos in 2018. The agency said the number represented about 400 per cent increase from the  1,266.400 kg impounded in 2017. The MMIA Commandant of the NDLEA, Ahmadu Garba, told journalists on Wednesday that the number quadrupled in 2018 as a result of the significant increase in the number of tramadol seized at the Lagos airport. According to him, top destinations of drug couriers arrested included Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, DR Congo, India, Mozambique, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Garba said the agency was able to record such increase as a result of the training of officials of the agency to identify suspects as well as collaboration with airlines. He said, “We were able to make this huge success in 2018 as a result of the cooperation by foreign airlines. “Every year, we look at the airlines with the highest number of people that are arrested and liaise with them on how to address the issue of drug trafficking.” He said about 30.14 per cent of the suspected drug couriers arrested during the year were coming into Nigeria and the remaining 69.89 per cent were on their way to different countries of the world with 13.70 per cent of them going to South Africa, which had the highest number. Garba said, “Out of the total number of 5,377.125 kilograms seized by the agency, 5002.900 were tramadol, representing 93.04 per cent. “Other drugs seized include cocaine, heroin, cannabis sativa, methamphetamine, ephedrine, psychotropic substance and dummy.”
