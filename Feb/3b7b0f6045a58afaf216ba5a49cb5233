Chevron Nigeria Limited has advised the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria to direct issues concerning employees of its contractors to the contractors themselves, saying that it does not interfere in the internal matters of its contractors. The oil giant was responding to a 21-day ultimatum by the MWUN, directing it to make available a list of all the maritime companies providing marine services for Chevron for the purpose of unionising their employees. In a response signed by the General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Chevron, Esimaje Brikinn, the firm stated, “Chevron Nigeria Limited, operator of the joint venture between Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and CNL,  encourages the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria to take any concern it may have directly to the employers of its members. “CNL does not interfere in the internal affairs of contractor-companies and their employees. “Our priority remains the safety of our entire workforce and security of our assets.” MWUN had, in a letter signed by its Secretary General, Mr Felix Akingboye,   accused Chevron of deliberately shielding its employees from being unionised. The letter read in part, “Reference is made to a tripartite meeting held on Thursday, November 24, 2016, between the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria and your management at the NIMASA Zonal office, Warri, Delta State, where your management was mandated to submit to NIMASA and the union, the comprehensive list of all maritime companies providing marine services for the purpose of the unionisation of their employees.
