East African countries can individually sign separate trade agreements with the European Union (EU) if a joint deal is not reached within the next four months. The agreement was reached at the summit in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha which was attended by Tanzania’s President John Magufuli, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwanda President Paul Kagame and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. “The summit … decided that the EAC engages the EU on the matter in the next four months to get more clarification on the pertinent issues of concern. Thereafter, partner states who wish to, may or may not sign the EPA,” the East African leaders said in a joint statement. At the summit, Museveni handed over the rotating chairmanship of the EAC to Kagame, who is also the current chairman of the African Union. It would be recalled that the East African Community (EAC) and the EU have been at loggerheads for years over signing the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), designed to replace preferential trade deals struck down by the World Trade Organization. Kenya and Rwanda signed the agreement in 2016 but it needs approval from all other members of the EAC bloc – Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan and Burundi – to take effect.
