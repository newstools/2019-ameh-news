The Post Clearance Audit (PCA), Zone A unit of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Lagos, recovered a total of N17,444,627,587 last year, a document sighted by The Nation over the weekend at the PCA’s Warehouse Road Office, Apapa, Lagos. According to the document, the recovery surpassed the ones made by the Unit in 2017 by more than N1billion. The figure of 2017 stood at N16,325,201,584 while in 2016, the unit made a total recovery of N15,592,024,702. Furthermore, the document indicated that the unit had recovered N8,698,124,641 between January and June 2018, making it N2,687,980,161 above the N6,010,144,480 collected in the corresponding period in 2017. The PCA unit of the NCS is saddled with the task of auditing documents of already cleared goods to ascertain if accurate duties were paid on such goods. Where short payments are discovered, the concerned parties are invited or given a demand notice (DN), informing them of what they owe government. This happens long after they have already taken delivery of the imported cargoes. According to PAC Customs Controller, Mohammed Kura, the feat of recoveries attained by the unit is the result of the alertness of the officers and men saddled with the responsibility. It is also a function of determination to ensure that government does not lose any revenue. The unit, he explained, uncovered several duty underpayments in various transactions and that after some attempts to argue them away, the defaulting parties were made to pay.
