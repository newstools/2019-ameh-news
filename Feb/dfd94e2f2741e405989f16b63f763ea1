The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) have resolved to go after unscrupulous elements who use mobile devices to defraud unsuspecting telecoms subscribers. To achieve this, the two agencies, working in collaboration with others, yesterday in Abuja, set up two joint committees. The committees are the Project Steering Committee (PSC), comprising the Infrastructure Concession & Regulatory Commission (ICRC), the Federal Ministry of Communications and the NCC; and the Project Delivery Team (PDT) which draws representation from the Federal Ministry of Communications, the ICRC, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the NCC. The committees, with specific terms of references, are to work together to ensure the implementation of Mobile Devices Management Systems (DMS), a Public-Private Partnership project, aimed at combatting the proliferation of fake, counterfeit, substandard and cloned mobile communications devices in the telecommunication industry. While inaugurating the committees in Abuja, CEO of NCC,Â  Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the move was in line with the mandate of the Commission, as enshrined in the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003, to type-approve all devices used in the telecommunications industry and to ensure that all devices used in the telecommunications industry are in line with agreed standards and specifications.
