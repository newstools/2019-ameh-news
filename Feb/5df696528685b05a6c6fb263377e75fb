The Apapa Area 1 Command of the Nigeria Customs Service said it generated N404bn in 2018, up from the N350.9bn that was generated during the same period in 2017. The Customs Area Controller of the Command, Bashir Abubakar, disclosed this while briefing newsmen in Lagos on Thursday. He said the amount realised was 95 per cent of the 2018 revenue target of N426.1bn. “This also shows that the command collected N53bn above the revenue generated in 2017,” he said. Abubakar attributed the success to the selfless stance of the officers and men as well as the support and back-up by the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (retd.) and his management team. He said that the strategy that the command adopted which led to the success was the instant seamless operation of the import and export businesses. “The strategies include an advanced system and monitoring, collaboration between internal and external units of the NCS and other government agencies.” He said that the strategies had helped to block most revenue leakages and enhance trade facilitation and security.
