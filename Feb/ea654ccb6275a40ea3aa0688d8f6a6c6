The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria has said that the Nigerian Braiding Manufacturers Limited will continue operations. In a statement on Friday, AMCON said it recently took over the NBML, a Kano State-based textile company, because of the company’s non-performing loans purchased from the banks by the government agency. In a statement signed by AMCON’s Head of Corporate Communications, Mr Jude Nwauzor, he said, “The textile company’s indebtedness to the corporation currently stands at over N1bn. This is despite numerous overtures by AMCON for amicable resolution of the debt to which the company and its promoters have remained nonchalant over the years, leaving the corporation with no choice than to seek justice in court.” The corporation stated that in line with the provisions of the AMCON Act, 2010 (as amended), the corporation approached the court and secured an order enabling it to take possession of the company through its Receiver Manager, Dr Yakubu Fobur, under whose supervision the company was billed to resume full production soon. It stated, “In contrast to the rumours, AMCON was set up to facilitate resolution of non-performing loans in the banking industry with a view to stabilising the economy.
