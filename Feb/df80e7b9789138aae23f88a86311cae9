United Bank for Africa Plc has collaborated with Google and ISP partner to launch Google Station in eleven key UBA branches in Lagos State as part of the plans to roll out 200 stations in the country. Google Station, a platform for providing free, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, began in Lagos last year, and extended to Abuja in December in partnership with Backbone Connectivity Network, the bank said. UBA said the Google-powered initiative would allow customers access to Internet connectivity within the eleven branches and its environs, thereby facilitating their day-to-day businesses and activities. At the official launch which took place at the UBA’s Head Office on Wednesday, the Executive Director/ Group Chief Executive Officer, UBA, Mr Chuks Nweke said, “It is an interesting platform which will ultimately benefit everyone. It is a win-win for everyone. Customers will have ease of doing businesses, especially with the growing use of smartphones, and the 52 million Nigerians who have otherwise been financially excluded will now have access to data through this collaboration and can carry out their transactions with ease. “Interestingly, SMEs, who previously had challenges with funding, can now do other things which they could not achieve before, such as accounting services and others. Also, UBA recently launched an educational app, and so, students will be able to use the Google Station platform to carry out their necessary research from the comfort of their homes. It is an awesome opportunity with benefits for everyone which we are presenting to our customers in line with our customer first philosophy.” Google Nigeria’s Country Director, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, said, “With the help of our partners, we are offering high-quality Internet access in heavily-trafficked areas like airports, markets, malls and bus stations throughout the country, especially in areas where there were no Internet connections before.”
