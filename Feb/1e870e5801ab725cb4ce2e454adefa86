The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) in collaboration with Future Assured Initiative has provided working tools to 10,000 women and youths in Sokoto State, North-West Nigeria, to enable them start their own business. The event, which was attended by the Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, represented by former Minister of Science and Technology, Mrs Pauline Tallen, was facilitated by Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC- Sokoto). The items distributed at the event include carpentry tools, cosmetology resettlement items, sewing machines, wheel chairs, electricity installation tools and concrete interlocks tools, among others. The Wife of the President said that the Future Assured Initiative will continue to support women and youth to be self-reliant: “Our initiative will continue to raise the living standard of women and youths and to complement the Federal Government’s efforts to generate employment and curtail poverty. “So, we are here in Sokoto State in collaboration with NDE to support no fewer than 10,000 women and youth with various working tools in order for the beneficiaries to stand on their feet.” Mrs Buhari commended the NDE and Sen. Wamakko for the giant strides toward supporting the living standard of the masses in Sokoto State. On his part, Wamakko said the gesture complements President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to lift the masses out of poverty: “This is part of the pledge we made to Nigerians in 2015, to create more job opportunities and improve the living standard of the people. “We have achieved a lot in this sector and all other sectors of our pledge, I am confident that Nigerians will testify to that.” The Director-General NDE, Nasir Ladan-Argungu, urged the beneficiaries to judiciously utilize the items to improve their living standard and that of their families.
