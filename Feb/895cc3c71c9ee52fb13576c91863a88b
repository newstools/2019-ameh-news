The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has stated that it has yet to identify the operator of the aircraft with worn out tyres pictures that are trending online. In a press statement signed by Mr. Sam Adurogboye, General Manager, Public Relations, the NCAA alluded to the regulations of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) that no airline operator can embark on commercial air transportation for hire and reward without airworthy operating aircraft. According to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) Part 5.4.1.1(b)”the Authority shall issue a Certificate of Airworthiness for aircraft registered in Nigeria based on satisfactory evidence that the aircraft complies with the design aspects of the appropriate airworthiness requirements (type certificate) and is in a condition for safe operation.‘’NCAA’s Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASI) are well trained and well motivated to carry out routine ramp inspection on all airlines operating in Nigeria. ‘’It is the primary responsibility of the Authority Inspectors to ensure that all the parts of the aircraft comply with the applicable airworthiness requirements and remained in a condition for safe operation before every flight and throughout its operating life,’’ said NCAA. In addition to the Authority oversight roles, NCAA has placed the onerous responsibility of the first line of safety on the operating airlines’ Pilot In Command of each flight and the assigned Engineer that authorised each flight. With all the various checks and counter checks put in place by NCAA combined with that of the operators, it is therefore improbable that any airline in Nigeria will operate a service with that kind of tyre. However, NCAA wishes to advise the original author of the post or any other individuals with  safety related issue,  if any to furnish the Authority with the identity of the airline  or any of such  information to enable her establish the authenticity of the claim and ensure appropriate action. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) will continue to carry out surveillance on the industry to ensure safety and security of airline operations in Nigeria and it is pertinent to point out that violation is viewed seriously.
