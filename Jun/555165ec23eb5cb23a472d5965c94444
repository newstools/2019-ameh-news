The Federal Government on Friday declared that it was reversing the adverse effects of land and air pollution in Nigeria. It disclosed this in Abuja while commemorating the 2019 World Environment Day, which had the theme ‘Air Pollution.’ The WED is celebrated on the 5th of June every year and is used to enhance political attention and action towards improving the environment. The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, Ibukun Odusote, said the government was reversing pollution in Nigeria through interventions in areas of pollution and waste management by creating waste recycling projects in various states of the federation. She said, “In addition, the ministry is presently aggressively pursuing the Low Sulphur Policy and Ozone Friendly Refrigeration Policy. All these efforts are geared towards reversing the adverse effects of both land and air pollution with resultant effects on the population, the ecosystem and the economy.” Odusote, who was represented by the Director, Human Resources Management, FME, Daniang Peter, said global studies had shown that on a yearly basis an estimated seven million people worldwide die untimely due directly or indirectly to poor air quality. She said it was also estimated that 92 per cent of the world population breathe unclean air and this costs the global economy a whopping $3.5tn annually. “Most worrisome is the issue of ozone layer depletion that has over the years gradually exacerbated the ever -increasing world temperature with the resultant effects on agriculture, humans health and biodiversity in general,” she stated.
