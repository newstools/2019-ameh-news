The Nigerian Export Promotion Council in Abuja on Tuesday launched a SERVICOM Charter  to  enhance its  services. The event  held in the council’s main auditorium was  attended by some key stakeholders in the export sector. In his address on  the occasion, the Executive Director/CEO of  the council, Mr Olusegun Awolowo, said,  “The role of    the council in the country’s economic diversification drive has never been in doubt and can therefore not be overemphasised, especially now that the  Muhammadu Buhari government  has placed more emphasis on the need for the nation’s economy to be more sustainable and inclusive through the non-oil export sector.” The NEPC boss said the Charter was  in line with the vision to provide prompt and effective service to the council’s customers at all times. He said, “The Charter is basically an operational tool to guide our business conduct with our core clients, the exporters, and other stakeholders who we are responsible and obliged to provide efficient services – as Trade Promotion Organisation – in line with expected international best practices”. Awolowo added, “Efficient service delivery at NEPC would ultimately translate into improved exports, inclusive growth, and increased revenue for the government, particularly NEPC’s vision of making the world a marketplace for Nigerian non-oil products and services.  “To this end, we expect our customers to constantly evaluate our performance and provide feedback on how to improve such services.”
