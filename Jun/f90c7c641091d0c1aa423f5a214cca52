 Tagged: “Happiness in the Little Things”, the initiative is aimed at showcasing the brand’s willingness to be part of the little moments and activities that bring happiness to the life of an everyday Nigerian. The campaign, which will run in series, will have each one highlighting different little moments in which people derive joy from. Happiness comes in various ways and forms. It can come from instances as random as getting back home after a long day and taking off those seemingly tight shoes, or from finding a charging point when your battery is one percent. It is that feeling when you find that last piece of suya after you thought it was finished. No matter how personal or insignificant, Maltina seeks to urge Nigerians on the need to embrace these moments by connecting with them and amplifying its stance on sharing happiness. From refreshing BRT bus commuters with nourishing cans of free Maltina to partnering some of the most family oriented events such as the AY Live, Gbenga Adeyinka’s Laffmattazz, Nick Fest, just to mention a few, Maltina has always found unique ways of putting smiles on the faces of Nigerians. “It is hoped that this campaign will teach Nigerians to imbibe the culture of happy living, understand the importance of always celebrating the tiniest happy moments, learn to share that infectious happy vibe around with friends and even strangers. With Maltina, everybody becomes family,” the firm said
