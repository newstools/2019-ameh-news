The Federal Government has commenced a process to review the National Urban Development Policy. The review of the policy document which was launched in 2012 is expected to provide overall focus and guidance for coordinated efforts by all stakeholders to achieve predetermined goals, and objectives, as well as collective aspirations in the urban development of the country. A document obtained from the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, on Thursday, showed that the ministry had taken the first step by bringing experts on human settlements development together to start the process. The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, Mohammed Bukar, stated that notwithstanding the fact that the 2012 policy document offered an impressive and most comprehensive guide for urban development, the present day reality in the country called for a review. He stated that the incidences of farmers/herdersâ€™ clashes, violent banditry, terrorism and insurgency had introduced a completely new dimension to issues of disaster management and resettlement called for the need to reassess the effectiveness of the institutional arrangement as well as provisions for monitoring and performance evaluation contained in the document. An interim draft of the revised NUD Policy has been generated and released for further examination by other levels of stakeholders.
