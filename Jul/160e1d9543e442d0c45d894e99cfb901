The Federal Government has approved new staff conditions of service for the Accident Investigation Bureau. The General Manager, Public Affairs, AIB, Mr Tunji Oketunbi, said on Tuesday that the approval was conveyed in a letter dated June 25, 2019, and sent to the bureau from the office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation. According to him, this is the first time the AIB will be having its own condition of service since it was established as an autonomous agency 12 years ago. He said the AIB was established through the Civil Aviation Act 2006 but became operational in 2007, adding that before then, it was a department in the then Federal Ministry of Aviation. “Before now, the agency had been using the conditions of service of a sister agency while its struggles to have its own for several years had been unsuccessful,” Oketunbi said. In a statement by the agency, the Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, AIB, Mr Akin Olateru, was quoted to have said the move was important for the entire members of staff of the bureau, towards improving their welfare and motivation in discharging their best at their various duty posts to enhance air safety.
