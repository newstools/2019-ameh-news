The PEPC has acceded to the request by President Muhamadu Buari for the striking out of a witness statement written by former Aviation Minister, Osita Chidoka, in support of the petition by Atiku Abubakar and the PDP. Chidoka served as the National Collation Officer of the PDP during the last presidential election and testified as a star witness for the petitioner. In its 4th ruling of the day, the court said the statement was incompetent, having been filed in violation of the provision of the Electoral Act. The court also struck out some other documents and portions of some processes filed by the petitioners.
