The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has said his administration will implement a programme for women that will allow them to have direct access to loans under the ‘Oko owo Dapo’ empowerment initiative. He said this in Ijebu- Ode while on an inspection tour of work going on at Ashafa-Oke and Degun. He said the initiative would avail government the opportunity to directly offer loans to the beneficiaries. He said, “In the next one week, we will be implementing our programme for our women; the programme for our women is an empowerment scheme, which allows us to directly offer loans to them. “The  loans will be given to them directly, not through any intermediary, we are choosing our women across the board, across the entire state, market women, people who are artisans , any woman who is engaged in any trade that requires for her to utilise a loan. We will give them soft loans that will be repayable over a period of time.” The governor also urged graduates, especially those with Higher National Diploma and Bachelor’s degree, to take up the opportunity of becoming agric- preneurs, saying that government would give lands and even allowances for their upkeep. “Take advantage of our agriculture sector programme, the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme, which will allow us harness those who want to be agric-preneurs on that portal…We will provide them with what they will plant, we will provide them with extension services, we will even give them allowances to maintain themselves,” he said.
