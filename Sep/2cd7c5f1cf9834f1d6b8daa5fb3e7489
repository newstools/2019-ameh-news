The Kaduna state Governor, Nasiru El-Rufai, says a six hundred million dollar steel plant will be completed by December 2020 in Kagarko Local Coucil. El-Rufai who disclosed this in an interview with newsmen shortly after he received the Emir of Kagarko, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar on a courtesy visit to his office, said that the Indian, Nigerian Afri steel plant would employ about 3,500 Nigerians upon completion. “It is a 600 million dollar investment and the money has already been secured, it is committed and they have started construction and by the Grace of God, it will be completed by December, 2020,” he stated. According to him, this would be the first company to produce steel from Iron ore in the state. “We have been trying to produce steel via Ajakuta for the past fifty years without success, so I am particularly happy to announce to Nigeria that Kaduna will be the first State to produce steel in Kujeni, Kagarko Local Coucil,” he added. He said it was a landmark achievement for his administration, as it was the largest single investment that has come into Kadauna State in the last five years. “Kagarko is the number one investment destination in the state because of the 600 million dollar investment,” the Governor added. The Emir of Kagarko, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar said that the aim of his visit was to thank the Governor for all the developmental projects that were carried out in their Local Coucil. The Chieftain pleaded with the Governor to ensure the speedy completion of the township roads presently being constructed in their Local Coucil. The royal Father also prayed for the successful tenure of the present adminstration, adding that, the LGA has set aside every Friday to say special prayers for the State and the Country .
