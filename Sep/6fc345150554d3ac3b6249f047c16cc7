The Nigerian Stock Exchange is set to launch an investment application called ‘X-Mobile’. The NSE, in a statement on Tuesday, described the app as a dynamic and user-friendly mobile application, which was designed to enhance investors’ participation in the Nigerian capital market. It said the mobile application, which was currently in a better state, would be launched at the 2019 NSE Market Data Workshop in Lagos. The NSE said the application was designed to provide market participants, especially retail investors, convenient, faster and real-time access to the Exchange’s activities. The statement read in part, “The app features market snapshots, stock prices, market analytics, financial news, dealing members directory and trade simulation. “With X-Mobile, users can create personalised watch lists to keep track of chosen securities, eliminating the need to access multiple information sources.” It added that the app was available free of charge on Google Play Store for download for Android smartphones, while the IOS version was in the testing phase. The Divisional Head, Trading Business, NSE, Mr Jude Chiemeka, noted that the delivery of the NSE Mobile App was consistent with Exchange’s new strategic intent to leverage the fourth industrial revolution and the era of digitisation to enhance the operation of the market. He said, “The introduction of X-Mobile is part of our engagement strategy with existing and potential investors who now have increased thirst for data and detailed disclosure information to make sound investment decisions. “This is one of the ways we are contributing to the attainment of Nigeria’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy of reducing the proportion of adult Nigerians that are ﬁnancially excluded to 20 per cent in the year 2020.”
