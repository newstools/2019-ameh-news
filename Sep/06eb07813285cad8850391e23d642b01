The Manufactures Association of Nigeria (MAN) said the leadership of MAN believes that the AfCFTA, like the two side of a coin, present opportunities for countries that are competitive and heavy challenges for those that are not. It therefore means that the critical determinants of the side of the coin that would become the lot of a country rest principally on the level of readiness for trade, availability of items to trade, prevailing strategic policy measure, the degree of competitiveness of its economy, especially its manufacturing sector.  The MAN President, Engr Mansur Ahmed, said this during his welcome address to all to the 2019 Manufacturers Annual Lecture/Presidential Luncheon, the advocacy and policy review segment of the 47th Annual General Meeting of the Manufactures Association of Nigeria (MAN)  The 2019 Manufacturers Annual Lecture of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria was held on Tuesday, September 3, 2019 at Lagos Oriental Hotel, Lagos.

The MAN President disclosed that the theme of this Annual General Meeting (AGM) is “improving the value-chain in the manufacturing sector for competitiveness and job creation“  and born out of the need to proactively examine the implications of the current economics exigencies in Nigeria and Africa, identify milestones to the robust manufacturing value-chain required for enhanced competitiveness and job creation.  He pointed out that the top on the list of these exigencies is the African continental free trade area (AfCFTA) framework agreement recently signed by the federal government after establishing credible basis for the decision, through private sector consultations and rigorous study to determine the economic impact of AfCFTA and the readiness of Nigeria to participate.  MAN noted that “as we have always maintained, AfCFTA would be beneficial  to Nigeria but it will also have some negative impact on the economy, particularly the manufacturing sector this is largely due to supply-side constraints and other risk that are associated with the backlashes of the legacy trade agreement entered into by some countries in Africa.”  “Association appreciates the Federal Government’s efforts aimed at addressing AfCFTA related concerns of manufacturer and would learn on the assurances that steps would be taken to mitigate the risk. We are also confident that government would give supportive measures that would strategically position the manufacturing sector to benefit immensely form this continental trade arrangement.
