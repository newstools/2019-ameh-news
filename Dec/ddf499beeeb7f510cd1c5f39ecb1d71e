Patronage of Nigerian Manufactured products, the Chief Executive Officers of MAN member-companies across the six geo-political zones of the country and the ten Sectoral Groups of the Association disagreed that patronage of Nigerian manufactured products has improved as a result of implementation of the Executive Order 003.  According to them, the Executive Order 003 which mandated all Government establishments to make Nigerian manufactured goods first choice in public procurement processes has not been conscientiously implemented.  “Patronage of Nigerian manufactured product by Government MDAs has improved particularly due to Executive Order 003. Unsurprisingly, formulation of laudable policies has never been an issue for Nigeria but evidence has shown that poor policy implementation has been the challenge in the country.  “Therefore, there is need to properly review the implementation processes of the Executive Order 003 to ensure that Government patronage of goods manufactured in Nigeria improves to boost the performance of the Nigerian manufacturing companies for increased contribution to national output and increased employment opportunities.
