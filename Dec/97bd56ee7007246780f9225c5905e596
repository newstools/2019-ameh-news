Nigeria spent a whopping N1.13 trillion on petrol importation between January and September 2019, latest report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed. The report stated that Nigeria still largely imports petrol (known as Premium Motor Spirit) as the country’s refineries remain in a moribund state. Though, there is a huge decline in the amount spent on petrol importation into the country, the border closure did not have much effect as the volume of petrol importation rose. The data also revealed that N2.28 trillion was spent on the importation of the commodity in the same period in 2018. It means the amount spent to import petrol dropped by N1.15 trillion, which represents a 50.33% drop. Petroleum product has continued to form an important driver of Nigeria’s foreign trade, and efforts to stop petrol importation by revamping the country’s refineries have continued to prove abortive. According to Kyari, “For a country that has been producing oil for over 50 years, it is really a difficulty to explain why we are still importing petroleum products. “We have a clear mandate of Mr President to stop this and we believe this can be done between now and 2023. It is not a political deadline; it is a realistic technical deadline that we can deliver,” With the new deadline, it means Nigeria has now shifted the deadline to stop importation three times, from 2017 to 2023. While the expenditure spent on importing petrol into the country has dropped significantly, petrol importation and subsidy payment remain endemic issues of the Nigerian economy.
