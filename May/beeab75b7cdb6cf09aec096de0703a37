We have continued to deleverage the balance sheet and self-fund investments into the existing portfolio from operational cash flow, while retaining the financial flexibility and available resources that will enable Seplat to capitalise on what we expect to be an increasingly busy pipeline of inorganic growth opportunities that fit our acquisition criteria.” – Sequencing of the 2019 work programme means the corresponding production uplift will be realised progressively throughout H2; 2019 capex guidance maintained at US$200 million (excluding investment in the ANOH joint venture). – Net cash generated from operations up 73% year-on-year at US$80 million (2018: US$46 million) versus capex incurred of US$16 million (2018: US$3 million).
