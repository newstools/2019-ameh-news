Kwara State Governor-elect, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has urged some investors in the United States to invest in Kwara. In a statement by his media aide,  Mr Rafiu Ajakaiye, the governor-elect recently held talks with some Kwara indigenes in Atlanta, Georgia in  the US, and promised to ensure a conducive environment for their investments in the state. He told them that he would build a state they would all be proud of in terms of infrastructure and conducive environment needed for businesses to thrive. “Our promise to you is that we are poised to build a new Kwara that all of us will be proud of. Our focus shall be on building sustainable infrastructure and a socio-political environment that is business-friendly,” he stated. He thanked the Kwara indigenes in diaspora for their moral support during the struggle to rescue the state, stating that the agenda before him was to evolve a Kwara that would work for all. “We are looking at taking full advantage of the agricultural potential of our state and you are welcome on board to invest in every sector. We assure you of every support to grow and protect your investments,” AbdulRazaq added.
