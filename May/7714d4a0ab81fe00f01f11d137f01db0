The Federal Government has approved N47 billion for the smooth take-off of Nigeria Air,  the Minister of Aviation, has said. The delay in the project’s take-off, according to sources was hinged on argument over modality and the changes in cabinet soon after inauguration. Some members of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, desired that the project should be 100 per cebt private-owned, while the others wanted the government to float the business first and later its equity shares. Commenting on the situation, the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi revealed: “On the National Carrier, the cabinet is divided on the issue of modality. “There are those who believe that the Federal Government should invest and then we can sell the equity later.” Meanwhile, commenting on the matter, the Minister of Aviation, Mr. Hadi Sirika, disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari had demanded that Viability Gap Funding should come from the 2019 budget which the Senate passed in April 2019 and was assented to by President Buhari recently.
