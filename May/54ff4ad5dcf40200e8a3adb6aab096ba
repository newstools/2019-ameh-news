The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has selected the Managing Director of LADOL, Dr. Amy Jadesimi, to join its Advisory Group. Dr. Jadesimi was selected by UNICEF to join its Advisory Group recognising her as an important partner with unique expertise, who could help to expand UNICEF’s vital work to address the enormous challenges and rapidly changing environment faced by children across the world. The Advisory Group will serve as an independent sounding board and “think-tank,” to explore lessons learned and exchange fresh ideas and perspectives on top-line global issues and developments affecting children and young people worldwide. The inaugural meeting of the Advisory Group was held in New York at the United Nations Headquarters in the first week of May 2019. Speaking on her selection, Dr Jadesimi has this to say: “It’s a great honour to be asked to join the UNICEF Advisory Group. Coming from Nigeria, a country where 41 % of the population is below the age of 15, I’m particularly keen to focus on improving the lives of young people. The innovations that UNICEF is already working on can transform billions of lives and help us achieve the UN’s SDG. I’m happy to assist in any way I can.” ALSO READ: LADOL MD, Dr Amy Jadesimi champion for more women leaders UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfil their potential, from early childhood through adolescence.
