The Nigerian Export-Import Bank, on Thursday, debunked rumours that the chairman of the bank, Dr Joseph Nnanna, was involved in corruption and fraudulent activities in the bank. In a statement, it said that the chairman “is a thorough-bred professional, a former member of staff of the International Monetary Fund, he is currently a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and was appointed the chairman of the board of directors of NEXIM Bank in March 2018.” The bank said that he had since then worked harmoniously with other board members to reposition the bank to deliver on its mandate and contribute towards achieving the economic diversification strategy of the Federal Government of Nigeria under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. The statement partly read, “Our attention has been drawn to the news circulating online indicating that some protesters under the aegis of the so-called and faceless ‘Awareness for Good Governance Group’ besieged the Presidential Villa gate on Monday, 29th April, 2019, and called for the immediate removal of the chairman of NEXIM Bank over involvement in corruption and fraudulent activities going on in the bank.”
