 President Muhammadu Buhari has  sent a congratulatory message to the new Catholic Archbishop of the Abuja Archdiocese, Ignatius Kaigama. Kaigama, who was named by the Catholic Pontiff, Pope Francis, replaced John Cardinal Onaiyekan. Onaiyekan has retired from service. “As the immediate past President of Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, a former Archbishop of Jos, former President of the Episcopal Conference of West African Catholic Bishops and former Chairman of the Plateau State Inter-religious Committee for Peace, the President recognises the roles Archbishop Kaigama had played in promoting peace,  inter-faith dialogue and mutual understanding between Christians and Muslims in the country. “As His Grace, Archbishop Kaigama begins a new phase of his ministry, the President joins all members of the Catholic Church across Nigeria in praying for a successful and memorable tenure in office that will see the Church accomplish great things for the unity and prosperity of the nation, while complementing government’s efforts at human and material development,” the Presidency said on Sunday. Buhari also congratulated Cardinal Onaiyekan on his retirement, recalling “his dedicated service to the Catholic Church, and invaluable contributions to the spiritual life of Christians under his pastoral care.”
