Access Bank says it is offering its customers free instant transfers for a week. A statement from the bank said this was its way of thanking its customers for their patience and understanding throughout the period of its technology and infrastructure upgrade. The upgrade involved the integration of all Access Bank’s platforms into a new, highly scalable and robust platform. Since the official merger of Access Bank and the Diamond Bank earlier this year, customers had carried on with their banking transactions as usual with no disruption as promised, it stated. It said, “The upgrade now offers the best digitally-driven financial solutions that will make transactions simpler, faster, convenient and more secure. “This is in addition to the improved feature where customers no longer have to select between ‘Access’ or ‘Access [Diamond]’ when transacting. All transfers to or from Access Bank accounts have been harmonised.”
