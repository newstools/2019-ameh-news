If AfCFTA regime is a competitive market and Nigeria is not in the aggressive export policy drive yet, how does the country intend to achieve the purpose of the agreement? On his part, President of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Mr. Increase Uche, stated that African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is all about efficiency of the supply chain.  Speaking on “The Role of Nigeria’s Freight Forwarders in the Emerging AfCFTA Regime with the theme: “AFCFTA: Boosting Nigeria’s Economy For Sustainable Development” recently.  The two-day national workshop was organized by Association of Maritime Journalists of Nigeria (AMJON) which was held at Ikeja, Lagos.  Uche, who was represented at the event by Mr. Fred Akokhia, explained that if Nigeria could produce everything but unable to take them even to Benin Republic; its efforts would amount to nothing.  The NAGAFF President lamented the country’s lack of production capacity and widening infrastructure deficit, adding that “if it (AfCFTA) is a competitive market, the challenge should be how to get yours to others before others get theirs to you and others.  According to him, aggressive export policy will overcome the fear of Nigeria becoming a dumping ground, but without a shipping line, deep seaport, viable road infrastructure, as well as lingering port congestion, and high and unstable tariff, Nigeria is least prepared to gain maximally from the export competition that AfCFTA entails.  The keys parameters in clearing of goods and services are yet to be streamlined for the borderless trade of AfCFTA adding that standardised tariff charges that means a value benchmark is not in place and others.   Therefore, he noted that above mentioned some are the bottleneck to AFCFTA. And without that the agreement will not go anywhere, he added.
