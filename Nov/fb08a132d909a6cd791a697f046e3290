The Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an Upstream Subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has disowned a recruitment exercise being orchestrated by miscreants employing text messages, social media platforms and forged letterheads to achieve their nefarious aim, a release today in Abuja by the NNPC Acting Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Samson Makoji, said. The statement warned unsuspecting members of the public to be wary of the activates of the fraudsters, saying recruitment exercise was the prerogative of the NNPC Corporate Headquarters in Abuja. It explained that members of the public should note that NNPC would always advertise vacant positions at appropriate times, advising that applicants should be properly guided. ‘’Anyone contacted for the purpose of the purported recruitment other than through advertisement duly placed by the corporation in national newspapers should not hesitate to report such invitations to the relevant law enforcement agencies,’’ the statement said.
