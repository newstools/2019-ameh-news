The Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers has accused the management of Nexen Petroleum of unfair labour practices over its refusal to negotiate with the union on Collective Bargaining Agreement since 2010. In a letter signed by its General Secretary, Afolabi Olawale, NUPENG stated that the intervention had become necessary “to forestall a serious industrial crisis in the country.” The statement read in part, “The union is worried and disturbed about the secrecy surrounding the acquisition of Nexen Petroleum by China National Offshore Corporation and the purported plan by the company to leave the country with workers’ benefits.” NUPENG noted that it might be forced to take appropriate trade union actions against Nexen Petroleum any moment from now without any further notice.
