 The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said he is ready to pay the ultimate price in the service of the people of the state. He said as long as the mandate of the governor was given to him by God for the service of the people, the state was worth dying for. The governor said this at an interdenominational church service organised by the Christian Association of Nigeria as part of activities to celebrate Alaghodaro (Progress) 2019, which marks the governor’s third year in office. Obaseki said, “People ask, is Edo worth dying for? I say yes, Edo is worth dying for. And if we have to die for the service of Edo State, so be it. But I am sure God will not let it happen that way.” He thanked members of the All Progressives Congress for their support through his three years in office.” The governor commended the APC leaders from the 18 local government areas for supporting his second term bid, noting, “They have thrown their weight behind me and urged me to continue the good works in the state, assuring me of their commitment and support.” He attributed the success recorded by his administration in the past three years to God, adding that the strides recorded are clear for all to see, as they are evident in the developments across the state. Obaseki said, “My first challenge as a governor was to correct the image of Edo State in terms of human trafficking. “Our women had lost their pride and respect globally. We didn’t live in denial but agreed to tackle the scourge and fought it headlong. Today, we have a good story to tell. “As a government, we showed our commitment to God and the people and it made Edo people trust our administration.” The governor commended the first civilian governor of the state, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, for speaking truth to power and not supporting injustice. He expressed appreciation to the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, for the fatherly role he played in helping his administration achieve many feats in the state.
