The Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru,  is expected to woo investors to the potential investments in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. He is billed to address foreign investors at the CERAWeek, an international energy conference scheduled for Houston, the U.S, today. Baru, who will speak during a Special Session titled: Africa: Foundations for New Investment, will be joined by some African petroleum ministers, heads of National Oil Companies (NOCs) and other global energy industry leaders. He is expected to discuss the abundant investment opportunities in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, particularly providing meaningful insights into key investment initiatives as they affect the country’s emerging capital projects within the oil, gas, power and the renewable energy sectors. In the same vein, Dr. Baru will be among African oil and gas industry leaders, who will join the U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in a private government-to-government meeting on trade engagement between the U.S and African countries. Organised by IHS Markit, CERA is a global platform on energy trends and public policy where over 4,000 oil and gas experts convene annually to debate the future of oil, natural gas, renewable energy, power and new technologies. This year’s edition will explore other big issues confronting the energy industry, hosting speakers such as U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo; OPEC Secretary General, Mohammed Barkindo and the  Crown Princess of Denmark, Mary Elizabeth among others.
