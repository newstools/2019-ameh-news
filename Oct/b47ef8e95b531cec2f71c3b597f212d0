Chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC), Alhaji Musliu Smith, has solicited the cooperation of Nigerians to strengthen the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). He said public partnerships with the commission would enable it give the country the type of police that would be the pride of all. The PSC chairman spoke on Thursday in Abuja while launching a three-year strategic action plan to enable the commission achieve its objectives. At the event, called citizen accountability/stewardship forum, Smith said the PSC would give Nigerians a police force that is not only accountable but respects human rights and meets international standards. According to him, this is possible, only through well thought-out plan of actions. The strategic plan, which covers 2019 to 2023, will be “our compass in the journey of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) we envision for our dear nation”. He added: “A study of this plan will exhibit our desires for professionalism of the police, accountability for human rights and a well-motivated and adequately equipped force. “Our actions as a commission have shown our faith with the action plan through merit-based promotions, prompt disposal of disciplinary matters, monitoring police conduct during elections, insistence on training and retraining, habitable and modern training institutions and better service conditions for the police.”
