The Nigerian Cabinet has approved a contract worth N718 million for the purchase of a mobile security scanner for the Apapa port, located in Lagos. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed revealed this to Journalists, soon after this week’s cabinet meeting chaired by the country’s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. The Minister said: “On behalf of the Minister of Transportation, I will report a memo he presented and which was approved by council. It was a memo for the award of contract for the supply of one mobile security scanner for the Lagos port complex. “The contract is worth N718, 651, 974.56 and the purpose of this memo is to supply this scanner which will enhance security at the Lagos port complex. Hitherto many vessels have refused to berth at the Lagos port because they have not been too satisfied with the level of security at the port and with this procurement and installation of the scanner it will enhance security at the port and also enhance revenue because more ships will now be willing to berth at the Apapa port.” Fake news
While answering a question on how government intends to tackle the menace of fake news and hate speech, he said government is proposing a review of the fine for airing of fake news or hate speech to N5 million for erring stations. He noted that mostly quacks are the ones promoting fake news and hate speeches through online outfits and the social media. He, however, praised the effort of the conventional media outfits, for abiding by the broadcast code of the country.
