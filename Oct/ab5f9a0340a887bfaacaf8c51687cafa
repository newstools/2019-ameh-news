Slyia, represented by the Executive Secretary of Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF), Mr Ahmed Boboi, said in Lagos on Friday that the essence was to entrenching energy security and deepening the drive for transparency in the downstream operations. He said that the strategic initiative was aimed at deploying adequate measures in ensuring all molecules of regulated petroleum product imported by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) are well accounted for and utilized in-country. According to him, `NNPC continues to record excellent performance in product supply and distribution to the nation – It is doing what it is supposed to do as supplier of last resort, but the reality is the nation bears a great cost in terms of absorbing the shocks of differences in cost. “It is critical that all hands be put on deck to ensure that every molecule of product imported into this country is utilized within the borders of this nation for the benefit of the Nigerian populace. “ This is a national imperative and a core thrust of Mr President’s mandate for leadership of the oil and gas industry. “Therefore, the task for us is to ensure that the petroleum products supply and distribution chain in Nigeria is completely devoid of illicit practices including oil theft, diversion and smuggling of petroleum products, which constitute economic sabotage and hemorrhage of the national revenue through high cost of under recovery,’’ he said. Then minister said: to do this certainly requires diligence, commitment, courage and robust partnership amongst various downstream stakeholders. “There is also a dire need to instill an improved culture of transparency, accountability and efficiency in the industry, streamline our operations along best practices by championing and implementing strategic reforms at every layer of the supply and distribution chain. “If we are able to plug the leakages, and tighten all loose ends, we are convinced that we can do even more with the little that we are getting at this moment of modest oil prices than we did even in the time of plenty. “ This administration is committed to placing the oil and gas sector on the trajectory of growth. It is my firm belief that all the initiatives contained in our 10 key priority areas will put the petroleum sector on the path of robust growth.
