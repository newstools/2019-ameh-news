The President disclosed this in a tweet on his official handle @MBuhari which read: “I have approved the sum of N10billion for an Intervention fund for the upgrade of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. I have the assurance of the Minister of Aviation that the work will be done speedily and to the highest standards. “Even as we have many items competing for our limited resources, we will continue to prioritize infrastructure investments in every part of the country. It is our responsibility to ensure Nigeria’s infrastructure is fixed; we will keep doing this,” President Buhari tweeted. The intervention fund approval follows an earlier meeting between the South-East leaders and with President Buhari at the State House Council Chambers in Abuja.
