Gospel artiste, Tope Alabi, and her husband, Soji, will join Pastor Bisi Adewale to discuss issues of divorce and marriage at this year’s edition of Lagos Singles and Married Conference. The conference organised by Family Boosters Ministry and themed: “Marriage 5-5-5′, will hold on October 27, at the National Stadium Gymnasium Hall, Surulere, Lagos. According to the host, Adewale, the conference is part of activities to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the ministry as well as to discuss issues destroying marriages and those to uphold before people commit to marriage. Adewale linked the continuous rate of kidnapping, terrorist attacks and other killings to the weak family institution, noting that the government is not responsible for the bad state of the nation, rather the weak family foundation. “If everybody is able to have good family and they are able to raise Godly children, there won’t be a single kidnapper, armed robber or criminal on the street,” he said.
