Wife of the Ekiti State Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, has cleared the medical bills of seven post-natal patients at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti. The Nation gathered that the patients had been detained in the hospital since September, following their inability to pay their respective medical bills. The governor’s wife, who received a whatsApp message on the patients from one of her aides and Coordinator, Ekiti Development Foundation (EDF), Mrs. Bunmi Alonge, around 4am on Friday, dispatched the Alonge and Alhaji Dauda Lawal to the hospital to verify the claims. According to Alhaji Lawal: “The cases were verified and it was discovered that seven patients, amongst who were two teenagers and five nursing mothers with ectopic pregnancy cases, had been discharged from the hospital at various times since September, but were not allowed to go home due to their indebtedness to the hospital.” Records available at the hospital showed that the seven patients were owing N682, 300.
