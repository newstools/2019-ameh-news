Struggling with losses of about N1.83 trillion, authorities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) at the weekend cancelled its three-tier share pricing methodology that allowed smaller trades to change prices of large and mid-cap stocks for a universal pricing rule for all categories of stocks. The main indicators at the Exchange declined consecutively for the five trading sessions last week to close weekend with average decline of 1.68 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N220 billion for the week. This further depressed the negative average year-to-date return to 15.58 per cent, implying that investors in quoted equities have lost about N1.83 trillion so far this year. Nigerian equities had closed negative in six of the past nine months. Under the new rule, the minimum trade quantity required to change prices for equity securities will be 100,000 shares for all categories of stocks as against the previous rule that prescribed minimum volume of 10,000 shares for predominantly large-cap stocks trading above N100 and 50,000 shares for mid-cap stocks trading between N5 and N99.99. With the new rule, all trades fewer than 100,000 shares in any of the stocks categories- small, medium, large, shall be regarded as small trades and will not result in a change in the publicly reported price of such security. The new rule took effect at the weekend. The amended pricing methodology implies that an investor that had spent N1.45 million to cause a change in the publicly reported share price of NSE’s second most capitalised stock, Dangote Cement, on Thursday under the old rule will now need N14.5 million to cause a change in price of same stock, at the same constant price of N145 per share, an increase of 900 per cent. With lower volumes and sell pressure, most large-cap stocks had hit new lows over the months, weighing considerably on the overall market position. For instance, Dangote Cement hit its lowest price in a year last week, closing weekend at N144.20 per share. The Exchange retains its price-limit rule that stipulates a maximum daily allowable price change of 10 per cent for all securities, irrespective of the direction of the price movement, up or down. The amendment does also not affect the tick sizes, incremental price movement rules, of the market. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Mr. Oscar Onyema, said the change was due to the need to ensure that all price-improving transactions are material, which will make the market more efficient and attractive. He assured that the Exchange remains committed to maintaining a platform that engenders a fair and efficient market. “We will continue to review our rules and rule-making processes to boost investor confidence in our market, while ensuring that NSE rules comply with international best practice,” Onyema said. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks share prices at the NSE, closed weekend at 26,533.78 points as against its opening index of 26,987.45 points for the week. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also declined correspondingly from its week’s opening value of N13.137 trillion to close weekend at N12.917 trillion. The ASI had opened 2019 at 31,430.50 points, 17.81 per cent down from its 2018’s opening index of 38,243.19 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities had opened 2019 at N11.721 trillion. The Exchange had on January 29, 2018, started implementation of the three-tier pricing methodology that saw the categorisation of quoted companies under three groups with different pricing rules. The first group consisted of large-cap equities priced at N100 per share or above for at least four of the last six trading months, or new security listings priced at N100 or above at the time of listing on the Exchange. The minimum volume of trade for change in publicly reported price for this group was fixed at 10,000 shares. The second category consisted of medium-priced equities priced at N5 per share or above but less than N100 per share for at least four of the last six months, or new security listings priced at N5 per share or above but less than N100 per share at the time of listing on the Exchange. The minimum volume of trade for change in publicly reported price for this group was fixed at 50,000 shares. The third category were equities priced at one kobo per share or above but below N5 per share for at least four of the last six months, or new security listings priced at one kobo per share or above but below N5 per share at the time of listing on the Exchange. The minimum volume of trade for change in publicly reported price for this group was fixed at 100,000 shares.
