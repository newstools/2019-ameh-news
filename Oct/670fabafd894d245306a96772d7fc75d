THE All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State has dismissed former Senate President Dr. Bukola Saraki as not possessing enough influence to save the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. The Secretary of the Media and Publicity Committee of the APC Campaign Council, Dr. Tom Ohikere, who spoke in Abuja at a media briefing, said Saraki was never a close friend of the people of the state to carry upon himself an impossible task. He said Saraki does not possess what it should take to facilitate the sort of reconciliation that can save the PDP in the state, which could be expected to save it from defeat in next month’s governorship election. PDP National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus last Friday named Dr. Saraki as the chairman of a five-man reconciliation committee, charged with the task of reuniting Jonathan and Idris with the PDP chapters in their home states. Ohikere said: “What does Bukola Saraki know about Kogi politics? He never established any warm relationship with our people, even the state chapter of the PDP, not even when he was Senate President. What did the state chapter of the PDP benefit from him? “Now all of a sudden, they want the PDP in Kogi State to defer to him, a party that is desperately struggling to find its bearing amid a surge of defections and altercations.
