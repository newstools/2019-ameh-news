The Director General of the Kogi All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Campaign Council, Senator Smart Adeyemi, has hailed the people of Kogi East Senatorial District for their support for the re-election bid of Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB). Adeyemi, who spoke at the weekend in Idah, on the sidelines of the launch of the APC campaigns, praised them for the large turnout at the rally. He said with the show of love from the people, it is clear that the party will win nothing less than 70 per cent of the votes from the senatorial district on November 16. Adeyemi said: “The people of Kogi East are wonderful people. This outcome today is quite overwhelming. You cannot compare it to the show of shame of Friday PDP launch of the campaign, where they battled hardly to get 5,000 people into the 25,000 sitting capacity stadium. “The crowd today in the eastern flank underscore the acceptability of the governor across ethnic divides. It shows that the east appreciate the governor, and it demonstrates further that GYB is super comfortable for the poll. “The opposition will battle to get 25 per cent of the eastern votes, because the APC will easily win 70 per cent of the votes. “We commend the east for their solidarity, love and support. They patiently stayed since morning. I feel like not leaving this town today. This is just too overwhelming. I’m short of words to show my appreciation to the eastern people.” He said the outpour of love would ginger the governor to do more during his second term. “The governor is prepared and capable for the task ahead. He will definitely do more for the people than he did in the past,” he added.
