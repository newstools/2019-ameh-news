SOME victims of last weekâ€™s fire incident in Onitsha, Anambra State, on Wednesday accused Governor Willie Obiano of not paying them a visit. The traders and their landlords said shops on Emordi and Amobi streets and Zik Avenue were mostly affected. One of the traders, Anthony Okonkwo, who spoke for others, said only the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chief Chris Ngige, visited and donated N3million to them. He said a beggar named Ajebo also gave them N3, 000. But, the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, said it was not true that the governor neglected the traders. He told The Nation that Obiano and other state officials visited the affected market and promised to support them.
